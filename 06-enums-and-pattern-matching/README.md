# ch6. enums and pattern matching

rust enums are similar to [algebraic data types](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type) commonly found in functional languages. this means that enums in rust are created from a combination of other types. this construction allows rust to benefit from checks and compiler guarantees found mostly in functional programming languages.
